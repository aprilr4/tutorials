        <article>
            <p>These days the majority of people accessing any web site you build <a href="https://searchenginewatch.com/sew/opinion/2353616/mobile-now-exceeds-pc-the-biggest-shift-since-the-internet-began">will be using a small mobile touchscreen device</a>. But there will still be a significant minority who will access that same site from a laptop or desktop device with a much larger monitor. This poses an interesting design dilemma: how do we build one site that looks and works well on both a tiny phone screen as well as a gigantic desktop monitor?</p>
<p>There is no one magic formula for this, but there are some best practices, as well as some powerful CSS features that let us adjust our page's appearance and layout based on the screen size.</p>
<h2 id="sec-mobilefirstdesign">Mobile-First Design</h2>
<p>Because the majority of web traffic is now coming from mobile devices, the current best practice is to design your site for a mobile device first, and only later consider how you can take advantage of the larger screen of a desktop. This is known as "mobile-first design." In general this boils down to the following principles:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Layout</strong>: Blocks of content should typically stack on top of each other on narrow screens, but sit side-by-side on wider screens. You can also use the <code>width</code> or <code>max-width</code> properties to constrain the overall width of your content so that it doesn't stretch to ridiculous line lengths on super-wide monitors. Content fixed to the viewport (<code>layout: fixed</code>) should be kept to a minimum on small screens, as it reduces the amount of scrollable screen real-estate.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Media</strong>: Large images and video look great on large monitors, but typically don't work as well on small screens. They also take much longer to download over slow mobile links. Consider using background colors or linear gradient fills instead of background images on mobile; or use lower-resolution images so that they download faster.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Fonts</strong>: Font sizes may need to be adjusted so that text remains readable as the screen size changes. You can also increase the size of headings or callout text on wider monitors to take advantage of the extra room.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Navigation</strong>: Site navigation links take up a lot of room on small screens and may end up wrapping to multiple lines. Keep the site navigation hidden on small screens and show it only when the user taps a menu icon (colloquially known as the "hamburger icon"). Most CSS frameworks (which we will learn about next) provide some kind of collapsible navigation on mobile.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Input and Interaction</strong>: Tap/click targets need to be large-enough on mobile to select using a finger, especially for people with poor eyesight or thick fingers. Tiny icons placed right next to one another, or one-word hyperlinks are difficult to select accurately. Specifying a data type on form fields (e.g., email address, phone number, date, integer) also generates optimized on-screen keyboards, making data entry much easier.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Content</strong>: For some sites, you may even want to adjust what content is shown to mobile users as opposed to desktop users. For example, a phone number might become a large "call" icon with a <code>tel:</code> hyperlink on phone-sized screens, but simply appear as a normal telephone number on larger screens.</p></li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sec-mediarules">Media Rules</h2>
<p>All of the style rules we saw in the <a href="../adding-style">Adding Some Style Tutorial</a> apply to all devices and screens regardless of size. But CSS now lets us define blocks of rules that apply only when the screen size is at least a particular width. We do this via <a href="http://www.w3schools.com/cssref/css3_pr_mediaquery.asp">media rules</a>, which look like this:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">/* rules that apply to all devices */
body {
    background-color: rgb(255,64,129); /* background color on small screens */
    font-size: 16px;                   /* default font size is 16 pixels */
}

/* rules that apply only to screens 768 pixels and wider */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    body {
        background-image: url(...);   /* use background image on larger screens */
        font-size: 18px;              /* increase font size to 18 pixels on larger screens */
    }

    .mobile-call-icon {
        display: none;                /* hide mobile call icon */
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>@media</code> rule defines a new block of style rules that apply only when the conditions of the <code>@media</code> rule are met. In this case, the <code>@media</code> rule condition is "the device width is at least 768 pixels." If the current device width is less than <code>768px</code>, the rules inside the block do not apply. If the width is equal to or greater than <code>768px</code>, they do.</p>
<p>All rules defined outside of a <code>@media</code> rule block will always apply to all screens. So you can define several rules at the top of your stylesheet that set your default formatting, and then adjust only the properties you need to change inside the <code>@media</code> rule block. Because they appear later, they override the same property setting in the earlier rules.</p>
<p>You can define as many <code>@media</code> rule blocks as you want in a stylesheet, each with a different condition, but most professionals define only a few that match the common breakpoints between phone, tablet, and desktop screen widths.</p>
<p>The rules inside the <code>@media</code> rule can alter the formatting of any element, including completely hiding or showing it using the <code>display</code> property. Setting <code>display: none</code> will remove the element from the page, and <code>display: block</code> or <code>display: inline</code> will show it.</p>
<h2 id="sec-flexbox">Flexbox</h2>
<p>On narrow screens content blocks should typically stack on top of each other, but on wider screens we should take advantage of the extra room and display at least some content blocks side-by-side. In the past, we used the <code>float</code> and <code>clear</code> properties to achieve multi-column layouts, but this technique was fraught with bugs due to browser inconsistencies. Thankfully, there is a newer standard specifically designed for multi-column layouts: Flexbox. </p>
<p>Flexbox requires one element to act as the row element, and one element per column in your layout. To make a four-column layout, your HTML and CSS would be like this:</p>
<pre><code class="html language-html">&lt;div class="flex-row"&gt;
    &lt;div class="flex-column"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Column 1&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
    &lt;div class="flex-column"&gt;
        &lt;h2&gt;Column 2&lt;/h2&gt;
        &lt;p&gt;...&lt;/p&gt;
    &lt;/div&gt;
&lt;/div&gt;</code></pre>
<pre><code class="css language-css">* {
    box-sizing: border-box; /* include padding and border is size calcs */
}

.flex-row {
    display: flex;          /* start a flexbox */
}

.flex-column {
    flex-grow: 1;           /* all columns equal size */
    padding-left: 0.25em;   /* a little padding inside each col */
    padding-right: 0.25em;
}</code></pre>
<div class="flex-row example"><div class="flex-column"><h2>Column 1</h2><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Odit libero, vero obcaecati pariatur reprehenderit nobis dolorum ratione. Reprehenderit deserunt esse quidem ratione pariatur suscipit voluptas illo ipsa consectetur, neque repellendus.</p></div>
<div class="flex-column"><h2>Column 2</h2><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ad culpa laudantium perspiciatis voluptate laborum cumque consequatur corporis, quisquam in sapiente suscipit veniam itaque explicabo dolore eos similique, ea distinctio optio.</p></div>
<p></div></p>
<p>To play around with this, try my <a href="https://codepen.io/drstearns/pen/vKVgrB">Flexbox CodePen</a>. Try adding more <code>&lt;div class="flex-column"&gt;</code> elements to the HTML to create more columns.</p>
<p>Flexbox is now well-supported amongst the major browsers, <a href="http://caniuse.com/#feat=flexbox">except for IE</a>. Thankfully, Microsoft's new Edge browser does support it, so this will be a short-term limitation. </p>
<p>On IE, your content will still display, but it will always be stacked and never side-by-side. If you must provide multi-column layout to IE users, you should use the float-based grid systems in one of the popular <a href="../css-frameworks/">CSS Frameworks</a> (Bootstrap, Material Design Lite, Materialize, etc.).</p>
<h2 id="sec-boxsizing">Box Sizing</h2>
<p>By default, browsers will apply widths like <code>50%</code> to just the content within a box and not the padding or borders on the box. But when we start creating multi-column layouts, we need the column size to also include the padding we put on the left and right; otherwise, the overall size of the columns will add up to more than the viewport width, and the last column will wrap to the next line.</p>
<p>To force the browser to take the padding into consideration when sizing the column, we set <code>box-sizing</code> to <code>border-box</code>. This ensures that the content plus the padding and any border will be sized to 100% of the containing element. Here we use the <code>*</code> selector, which selects every element in the page, so this setting will apply to all elements. We could be more targeted and set <code>box-sizing</code> only on the <code>.flex-column</code> rule, but this setting is what you want most of the time on all elements when doing multi-column layouts, so it's common practice to just apply it to all elements using the <code>*</code> selector. </p>
<h2 id="sec-responsiveflexbox">Responsive Flexbox</h2>
<p>The above example creates a multi-column layout on all screens, but we can make this responsive by adding some <code>@media</code> rule blocks, and adjusting a few properties. Let's start by making the columns stack on top of each other on small phone screens, but sit side-by-side on wider screens:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* rules for screens 780px and wider */
@media (min-width: 780px) {
    .flex-row {
        display: flex;
    }

    .flex-column {
        flex-grow: 1;
        padding-left: 0.25em;
        padding-right: 0.25em;
    }
}</code></pre>
<div class="flex-row-md example"><div class="flex-column"><h2>Column 1</h2><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Odit libero, vero obcaecati pariatur reprehenderit nobis dolorum ratione. Reprehenderit deserunt esse quidem ratione pariatur suscipit voluptas illo ipsa consectetur, neque repellendus.</p></div>
<div class="flex-column"><h2>Column 2</h2><p>Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur adipisicing elit. Ad culpa laudantium perspiciatis voluptate laborum cumque consequatur corporis, quisquam in sapiente suscipit veniam itaque explicabo dolore eos similique, ea distinctio optio.</p></div>
<p></div></p>
<p>Note that we just moved the <code>flex-row</code> and <code>flex-column</code> rules into a <code>@media</code> rule that applies to screens <code>768px</code> and wider. On narrow screens, the <code>display: flex</code> won't be applied to the <code>&lt;div class="flex-row"&gt;</code> element, so the columns will simply stack on top of each other, as <code>&lt;div&gt;</code> elements normally would.</p>
<h2 id="sec-multiplelayouts">Multiple Layouts</h2>
<p>What if we have four columns, and we want them all to stack in a 4x1 layout on narrow mobile screens, switch to a 2x2 layout on tablet screens, and switch to a 1x4 layout on wider desktop screens? We can do that by using a few more flexbox properties</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">* {
    box-sizing: border-box;
}

/* rules for screens 768px and wider */
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .flex-row {
        display: flex;
    }

    .flex-column {
        flex-grow: 1;
        padding-left: 0.25em;
        padding-right: 0.25em;    
    }
}

/* rules for screens 1200px and wider */
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .flex-column {
        flex-basis: 25%;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>When we adjust <code>flex-basis</code> to <code>50%</code>, the columns now take up half the row width, allowing two columns to sit side-by-side on each line on screens 490px to 780px. On wider screens <code>flex-basis</code> goes to <code>25%</code>, giving you a four-by-one layout.</p>
<h2 id="sec-responsivecontainerelements">Responsive Container Elements</h2>
<p>By default the <code>&amp;lt;body&amp;gt;</code> element will stretch to be as wide as the browser window (also called the "viewport"), and all block elements within the body will also stretch to be as wide as the body. This works well on narrower screens but it creates ridiculously wide layouts and long line-lengths on very wide desktop monitors, making your site difficult to read. It's common to have background images and colors stretch "wall-to-wall" but the main text content is often constrained in width so that it remains easy to read on all sizes of screens.</p>
<p>This is typically achieved by putting the main content of the page or a section in another element that is often called a "container." These container elements are just <code>&amp;lt;div&amp;gt;</code> elements with a style class name like <code>container</code>. We can then create a CSS rule that constrains the width of these elements.</p>
<p>For example, this is how the popular CSS Framework <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/css/#overview-container">Bootstrap</a> defines their container class rules:</p>
<pre><code class="css language-css">.container {
    margin-left: auto; /* keeps the element horizontally centered */
    margin-right: auto;
    padding-left: 15px;
    padding-right: 15px;
}
@media (min-width: 768px) {
    .container {
        width: 750px;
    }
}
@media (min-width: 992px) {
    .container {
        width: 970px;
    }
}
@media (min-width: 1200px) {
    .container {
        width: 1170px;
    }
}</code></pre>
<p>Setting <code>margin-left</code> and <code>margin-right</code> to <code>auto</code> will ensure that the container element remains horizontally centered when its width begins to be constrained, which happens on screens wider than <code>768px</code>. They increase the <code>width</code> of the element as the screen size increases, but only up to a point: the largest it will ever grow is <code>1170px</code> on screens wider than <code>1200px</code>.</p>
<p>To experience what this looks like, just resize your browser window. This site was built using Bootstrap, and the tutorial content is inside a <code>&amp;lt;div class="container"&amp;gt;</code> element. You'll notice that the text will grow in size as you make the screen wider, but only up to a maximum of <code>1170px</code>. This keeps the line-lengths reasonable so that they are easy to read even when the browser window is very wide. But the header background image always stretches wall-to-wall.</p>
