            <p>Welcome to INFX Beginning Web Development! This is an entirely online course that will teach you the basics of client-side web development. This is a true beginner's course: it assumes no prior programming experience, and the difficulty level is set for those who have never done any kind of programming before.</p>

<div class="media-body"><p>My name is <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/people/faculty/dlsinfo">Dave Stearns</a> and I will be your primary instructor. I'm a Senior Lecturer at the UW Information School, where I've been teaching since 2013. I mostly teach our undergraduate client-side and server-side development courses, as well as our large 200-level survey course on the Intellectual Foundations of Informatics. Prior to coming to the iSchool, I worked in the software industry since 1991, and I've been involved in web development since 1995. A lot has changed over the last two decades, most of it for the good, but some of it...not so much. In this course I'll help you focus on the fundamentals, and adopt the best practices that most web developers had to learn the hard way.</p></div>

<div class="media-body"><p>I'm joined by <a href="https://ischool.uw.edu/people/phd/kimsk">Ada Kim</a>, who will be your TA. Ada is a PhD student at the iSchool, studying Digital Youth and Human-Computer Interaction. She is currently working on the <a href="http://badges.ischool.uw.edu/">digital badge project</a>, where she is investigating the role of informal learning in identity development, and how to facilitate both learning and socializing in out-of-school settings. She has an MA and MS in psychology as well as a BA in Psychology and English Literature. As a hobby, she publishes news articles and letters on a Korean-language web magazine.</p></div>

<h2 id="sec-coursestructure">Course Structure</h2>
<p>The course is divided into <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100190/assignments/syllabus/#infx598-schedule">ten modules</a>, each lasting a week. We start by learning how to <a href="../managing-files/">manage our files</a> using the version control system git, and the collaborative cloud repository service GitHub. Then we learn how to encode information into HTML, how to add some style to those pages, how to make them responsive to the device, and how to leverage existing CSS frameworks. After the first half of the course, you will have developed the skills necessary to build attractive, engaging, and responsive web sites.</p>
<p>During the second half of the course, you will learn how to use JavaScript to build interactive web applications. After learning the basics of the JavaScript language, you'll discover how to dynamically modify your web pages in response to user interactions. You'll also learn how to create HTML content from data, and fetch that data dynamically from a web service.</p>
<p>The last week of the course lets you apply all of the skills you've learned to a project of your own choosing. This could be a personal portfolio site, or a website for an organization you volunteer with, or a new tool you've been wanting to build. This project may be done individually, or in teams.</p>
<p>For each of these modules, you will read a few tutorials, occasionally watch a demonstration video, and then complete a challenge. The challenge allows you to practice and demonstrate the skills you learned in the tutorials, while building and publishing a web site or application you could include in your portfolio.</p>
<h2 id="sec-interactionandcommunication">Interaction and Communication</h2>
<p>This is an entirely online course, so you won't be coming to a classroom and sitting through a lecture. All the work will be done asynchronously, but both Ada and I will be available to answer questions and help you when you get stuck. As noted in the <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100190/assignments/syllabus/#infx598-comm">Communication section of the Canvas course website</a>, you should post any questions you have to our <a href="https://infxwebwin17.slack.com/messages/general/">Slack team's general channel</a> so that others can see the answer (you're probably not the only person with that question). If you'd like to ask something more personal, feel free to send a direct message instead.</p>
<p>We will endeavor to answer questions promptly, but please remember that we have other responsibilities in addition to this course, so we may not be able to answer you immediately. Also keep in mind that we are in Seattle, so we won't typically be online from 6:00pm to 9:00am Pacific Time.</p>
<p>If you want to have a synchronous live chat, we can do that via <a href="https://zoom.us/">Zoom</a> or some other video conferencing tool. Send a direct message to schedule a time to chat.</p>
<p>And if you happen to be near the UW Seattle campus, you can also schedule an in-person meeting. Send a private message to arrange a time.</p>
<h2 id="sec-courserules">Course Rules</h2>
<p>Please review the <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100190/assignments/syllabus/#infx598-rules">Course Rules</a> section on the Canvas course website homepage. You are responsible for reading and abiding by those rules. No excuses.</p>
<h2 id="sec-getstarted">Get Started!</h2>
<p>That's all you need to know to get started. Get your machine ready for web development by installing the tools listed on the <a href="../getting-setup/">Getting Setup Tutorial</a>, and then go through the <a href="../managing-files/">Managing Your Files Tutorial</a> to learn the basics of git and GitHub. Your <a href="https://canvas.uw.edu/courses/1100190/assignments/3514568">first challenge</a> is due on Monday January 9 by 8:30am.</p>
