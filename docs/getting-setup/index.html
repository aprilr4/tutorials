            <p>Before you get started with this course, you need to install a few tools and create a few accounts. All of these things are free and available on all major platforms (Windows, OS X, and Linux).</p>
<h2 id="sec-requiredtoolsandaccounts">Required Tools and Accounts</h2>
<p>To get setup, please do the following:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Install <a href="https://slack.com/downloads">Slack</a>.</strong> Although you can use their <a href="https://infxwebwin17.slack.com/messages/general/">web interface</a>, their native desktop and mobile applications are nicer, and remain running so they can immediately notify you when someone sends you a direct message, or posts an answer to your question. We will invite you to the Slack team at the start of the quarter.</li>
<li><strong>Sign up for <a href="https://github.com/join">GitHub</a>.</strong> GitHub is a web service that helps you manage and share your files. It's kind of like Dropbox or Google Drive, only much more powerful, and specifically optimized for code files. You will learn all about GitHub during our week on <a href="../managing-files/">Managing Your Files</a>.</li>
<li><strong>Install <a href="https://desktop.github.com/">GitHub Desktop</a>.</strong> This tool will help you manage your files on your local machine, and synchronize them with GitHub. After you install it, run it once to go through the initial setup. You will need to enter your GitHub username and password.</li>
<li><strong>Install <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">Visual Studio Code</a>.</strong> This is a fabulous free code editor from Microsoft that is highly-optimized for web development. Other popular editors such as <a href="https://atom.io/">Atom</a> or <a href="http://www.sublimetext.com/">Sublime Text</a> will also work, but all of my tutorials and video demonstrations will be done using Visual Studio Code. After installing, please read through <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/codebasics">The Basics of Visual Studio Code</a> to get familiar with the tool.</li>
<li><strong>Install <a href="https://www.google.com/chrome/">Google Chrome</a>.</strong> Although any browser will be able to display the web sites we build, you will want to use one with built-in developer tools so that you can more easily diagnose and fix problems with your code. Chrome has an excellent set of developer tools, and I will demonstrate how to use them. <a href="https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/">Mozilla Firefox</a> has a very similar set of developer tools but the user interface is slightly different.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="sec-optionaltoolsandaccounts">Optional Tools and Accounts</h2>
<p>These tools are optional, but might be of interest to those who are comfortable using the command line:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://nodejs.org/en/download/">Node.js and NPM</a>.</strong> If you want to use the more advanced command-line tools, you will need the node.js runtime and the <code>npm</code> package manager.</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://www.browsersync.io/">BrowserSync</a>.</strong> This handy tool can watch your source files and automatically reload your page in the browser anytime those source files change. It requires Node.js and <code>npm</code>, so make sure you install that first. Then install this tool via the command line by running <code>sudo npm install -g browser-sync</code>.</li>
</ul>
